FinCred: Line of Credit(LOC) Auto-Approval Application

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
FinCred is an ML-powered application that helps users determine their eligibility for a Line of Credit (LOC) or loan. It uses Machine Learning (ML) to evaluate applicant data, inspired by TransUnion's FICO score system. With the guidance of a Senior Data Analyst at TD Bank, it generates a synthetic dataset of 5,000 entries using critical data points (income, debt, credit utilization) and predicts credit scores, approval status, approved credit limits, and interest rates.

ðŸš€ Tech Stack
Frontend: Flask (API)

Backend: Python (Flask)

Machine Learning: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

Data Generation: Python (Numpy, Pandas)

ðŸŒŸ Key Features
Instant LOC eligibility assessment.

Synthetic data generation for model training (5,000 rows).

Credit score calculation based on FICO-like model.

Real-time approval status, limit, and interest rate predictions.

ðŸ“Š Project Workflow
